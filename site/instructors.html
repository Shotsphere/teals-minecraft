  <h1 class="title">TEALS Minecraft Project</h1>
  <h1 class="subtitle">Instructors’ Introduction</h1>


  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>For a general overview of the project, see the <a href="../index.html">home page</a>.

  <p>This project is designed to take place after the AP Computer Science A exam, around April/May
  of the APCSA course. Following the exam, APCSA instructors generally have four–six weeks to
  explore as they see fit. This project sets up students with a Minecraft “client” (a program that
  runs locally, instead of on a server) that they can set up, build, and run in a development
  environment such as IntelliJ or Eclipse.

  <p>This project comprises a set of <a href="units.html">lessons &amp; labs</a> that progress
  through various aspects of the Minecraft world, learning as they go.


  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <p>This project requires a computer running Windows for each student/team, and which has installed
  on it either the IntelliJ or Eclipse IDE (Integrated Development Environment). In theory this
  project can be made to run on Mac OS X, or on other IDEs, but these environments have not been
  tested, and will likely take a bit of fiddling to get running. (We'd love to help you out with
  alternative environments, though.)

  <p>In addition to the above, you'll also need Java 1.6+.


  <h2>Setup</h2>
  <p>Setup should be easy. Download the latest package (see the “Download” link above), unzip the
  contents to a local working directory, and then see the README file to walk you through the
  remaining steps, depending on your IDE (Eclipse or IntelliJ).


  <h2>Resources</h2>
